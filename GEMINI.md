# GEMINI.md

This file provides a comprehensive overview of the Tuturuuu monorepo for Gemini, outlining the project structure, key technologies, and development conventions.

## Project Overview

This is a monorepo for the Tuturuuu platform, a collection of web applications and services. The project is managed using Turborepo and utilizes `bun` as the package manager.

The main application is a Next.js web application located in `apps/web`. The project also includes a documentation site, an AI chatbot, a prompt engineering platform, and other services.

The frontend is built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, with a component library from `packages/ui` based on shadcn-ui and Radix UI. The backend is powered by Supabase.

### Key Technologies

-   **Monorepo:** Turborepo
-   **Package Manager:** bun
-   **Framework:** Next.js
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **UI Components:** shadcn-ui, Radix UI
-   **Backend:** Supabase
-   **Testing:** Vitest
-   **Linting & Formatting:** Biome

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22+)
-   [bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.2+)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (latest)

### Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun i
    ```

2.  **Start the Supabase local development environment:**
    ```bash
    bun sb:start
    ```

3.  **Create environment files:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in each app directory (`apps/*/.env.local`) using the corresponding `.env.example` template and add the Supabase URLs and keys from the previous step.

4.  **Start all applications in development mode:**
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

### Key Commands

-   `bun i`: Install dependencies.
-   `bun dev`: Start all applications in development mode.
-   `bun build`: Build all applications.
-   `bun test`: Run tests.
-   `bun sb:start`: Start the local Supabase development environment.
-   `bun sb:stop`: Stop the local Supabase development environment.
-   `bun format-and-lint:fix`: Format and lint all files.

## Development Conventions

-   **Package Management:** All packages are managed with `bun` workspaces.
-   **UI Components:** The `packages/ui` directory contains the shared UI component library. New components can be added using the `bun ui:add` command.
-   **Code Style:** The project uses Biome for linting and formatting. Use `bun format-and-lint:fix` to automatically fix any issues.
-   **Testing:** Tests are written with Vitest. Run all tests with `bun test`.
-   **Commits:** Commits should follow the Conventional Commits specification.
-   **Environment Variables:** Global environment variables are defined in `turbo.json`. Each application can also have its own `.env.local` file for local development.
-   **Internationalization:** The project supports multiple languages via `next-intl`. **CRITICAL**: Always provide translations for both English (`en.json`) AND Vietnamese (`vi.json`) when adding user-facing strings to `apps/web/messages/{locale}.json`. Never add translations only for English - Vietnamese translations are mandatory.

## Agent Operating Instructions

This section summarizes the key operating procedures for AI agents working in this repository, based on `AGENTS.md`.

### Core Principles

-   **Least Privilege:** Only touch files required for the change.
-   **Idempotency:** Scripts and migrations should be safe to re-run.
-   **Determinism:** Generated artifacts (like types) must come from scripts, not manual edits.
-   **Security:** Never output or commit secrets. Reference environment variables by name only.
-   **User Intent:** Do not run long-running commands (`bun dev`, `bun build`) unless explicitly asked. The user is responsible for running commands like `bun sb:push`, `bun lint`, and `bun format`.

### Prohibited Actions

-   Committing secrets, API keys, or credentials.
-   Disabling linting, formatting, or type-checking.
-   Executing destructive database commands without a reversible strategy.
-   Running `bun sb:push`, `bun sb:linkpush`, `bun lint:fix`, or `bun format:fix`. Prepare the changes and ask the user to run these commands.

### Key Workflows

-   **Dependency Management:** Use `bun add <pkg> --workspace=@tuturuuu/<scope>` to add dependencies. Use `workspace:*` for internal packages.
-   **Database Migrations:**
    1.  Create a new migration with `bun sb:new`.
    2.  Edit the generated SQL file.
    3.  Ask the user to apply the migration (`bun sb:push`) and regenerate types (`bun sb:typegen`).
    4.  Incorporate the newly generated types from `packages/types` into your changes.
-   **Adding API Routes:** Create new routes in `apps/<app>/src/app/api/...`. Use Supabase client wrappers for authentication and Zod for input validation.
-   **Navigation Updates (CRITICAL):** When adding new pages or routes, **ALWAYS** update the main navigation file (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/[wsId]/navigation.tsx` for web app). Add routes to both the `aliases` array and `children` navigation items. Include proper icons, permission checks, and translation keys. **CRITICAL**: Ensure translation keys have entries in both `en.json` AND `vi.json`. Navigation updates are mandatory, not optional.
-   **Documentation:** When adding a new feature or changing an existing one, update the corresponding documentation in `apps/docs`. **Crucially, add any new page to `apps/docs/mint.json` to make it visible.**
-   **Styling:** Follow the **Tailwind Dynamic Color Policy**. Never use hard-coded color classes like `text-blue-500`. Instead, use the `dynamic-*` tokens, e.g., `text-dynamic-blue`.
-   **UI Components:**
    -   Use `sonner` for toasts: `import { toast } from '@tuturuuu/ui/sonner';`. Avoid the deprecated `@tuturuuu/ui/toast`.
    -   Use the dialog system for modals: `import { Dialog, ... } from '@tuturuuu/ui/dialog';`. **Never** use native browser dialogs like `alert()` or `confirm()`.
