# Specification: Foundapack Aesthetic Overhaul & The Alpha Pack

## Overview
Transform the current Foundapack landing page into a deeply immersive "Wolf Pack & Campfire" experience. This includes a complete visual overhaul, the introduction of "The Council" (Alpha Pack) featuring core members, and the integration of "Pack Emblems" (Project Territory) showcasing the ventures within the ecosystem.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. The Alpha Pack (The Council)
- **Section:** Create a dedicated "Council" section prominently featuring core members.
- **Member Cards:**
  - Display member name, role, and associated venture.
  - Use **Spectral Silhouettes** (dark, translucent with faint orange glow) for members without avatars.
  - **Interactions:**
    - **Magnetic Effect:** Cards subtly pull toward the user's cursor.
    - **Hover Glow:** Intense campfire glow illuminates the card on hover.
    - **Project Linkage:** Clicking a card or specific link navigates to the associated project website.

### 2. Pack Emblems (Project Territory)
- **Visuals:** Showcase website preview images for the main ventures:
  - **Tuturuuu:** [https://tuturuuu.com](https://tuturuuu.com)
  - **AICC:** [https://neuroaicc.com](https://neuroaicc.com)
  - **Noah:** [https://noahfloodrescuekit.com](https://noahfloodrescuekit.com)
- **Integration:** Style these as "Emblems" representing the territory claimed by the pack.

### 3. Core Members List
- **Tuturuuu:**
  - Vo Hoang Phuc (Founder & CEO)
  - Nguyen Thuy Tien (Growth Lead)
- **AICC:**
  - Trinh Hoang Xuan Nghi (Co-founder)
  - Trinh Phuong Thao (Co-founder)
  - Shirin Shujaa (Co-founder)
- **Noah:**
  - Matsumi Toida (Co-founder)
  - Trinh Nhat Nghi (Co-founder)
  - Thai Thi My Yen (Member)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Aesthetic Enhancements
- **Lighting:** Implement deeper, moodier lighting with dynamic campfire glow and flickering shadows.
- **Textures:** Introduce rugged, organic textures (wood grain, fur patterns, deep starry sky).
- **Motion:** Enhance particle effects (embers, sparks) and ensure animations feel "weighty" and smooth.
- **Typography:** Utilize thematic fonts (rugged serifs/handwritten) and an organic, grid-breaking layout.

### 2. Performance
- Ensure high-fidelity animations and particle effects do not compromise scroll performance (target 60fps).
- Optimize project preview images for fast loading.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The landing page feels immersive with a clear "Campfire" atmosphere.
- [ ] "The Council" section accurately lists all core members with correct roles.
- [ ] Member cards exhibit magnetic pull and hover glow.
- [ ] Project preview images are displayed and link correctly to their respective sites.
- [ ] Placeholders follow the "Spectral Silhouette" style.
- [ ] The layout feels organic and avoids a "generic corporate" look.
