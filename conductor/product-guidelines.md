# Product Guidelines: Tuturuuu

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone
Tuturuuu speaks with a voice that is **Professional, Visionary, and Human**. We aim to be a trusted partner in a high-stakes digital world, while inspiring users with the potential of an AI-native future.

*   **Professional & Trustworthy:** We are an operating system. Our language must be clear, precise, and authoritative, especially regarding security, finance, and data integrity.
*   **Visionary & Inspiring:** We don't just build features; we build the future. We use evocative language to describe "The Age of Partners" and "Your Life, In Sync."
*   **Human & Empathetic:** Like Mira, our AI companion, the brand is warm and approachable. We avoid overly cold, technical jargon in favor of empathetic, user-centric communication.

## 2. Design Principles (The Tuturuuu Experience)
Our design philosophy is centered on creating a frictionless, intelligent interface that amplifies human potential.

*   **Radical Simplicity:** We fight digital noise. We minimize cognitive load by hiding complexity until it's needed. The interface should feel "invisible."
*   **Intelligent Context:** The UI is not static. It anticipates user needs based on their current task, providing smart suggestions and adaptive layouts.
*   **Seamless Motion & Fluidity:** Every interaction must feel responsive. We use high-quality, purposeful animations to provide feedback and maintain the user's flow, supporting our <100ms latency goal.
*   **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Tuturuuu is for everyone. We adhere to WCAG standards and ensure a consistent experience across all devices and locales (e.g., Vietnamese and English).

## 3. Communication Guidelines
*   **Prose Style:** Concise and active. Avoid passive voice. Use bullet points for complex information.
*   **Internationalization:** We are the "Google of Vietnam" with a global reach. Always prioritize high-quality translations (English & Vietnamese) and culturally sensitive imagery.
*   **AI Persona (Mira):** When AI speaks, it should be supportive, never condescending. It should acknowledge its own limitations and always defer to the user's final decision.

## 4. Community & Contribution Standards
As an open-source project, we thrive on transparency and collaboration.

*   **Transparent Innovation:** We build in public. Roadmaps, architectural decisions, and bug trackers are open for community participation.
*   **Rigorous Excellence:** We maintain high standards for all contributions. Code must be well-tested, documented, and aligned with our established design patterns.
*   **A Culture of Mentorship:** We actively welcome new contributors, providing clear paths for participation and constructive feedback.

## 5. Security & Trust Messaging
*   **Privacy First:** We never "sell" user data. We use phrases like "Your data, your control."
*   **Transparent Security:** Be clear about MFA, E2EE, and our SOC2-compliant infrastructure. Use simple analogies to explain complex security features to non-technical users.
