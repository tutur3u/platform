# Initial Concept
The user wants to build Tuturuuu, an intelligent, open-source operating system for modern work and life. It aims to be a unified, AI-first platform that eliminates digital friction and misalignment, serving as a global technology powerhouse ("Google of Vietnam").

# Product Guide: Tuturuuu

## 1. Product Vision & Mission
*   **Vision:** To build an **intelligent, open-source operating system for modern work and life** that rivals global tech giants. We aspire to be the "Google of Vietnam"—a global technology powerhouse that touches everyone's lives.
*   **Mission:** To eliminate "digital friction" and misalignment. We automate the "work about work" (scheduling, organizing, context switching) so humans can focus on high-value creativity and problem-solving.
*   **Philosophy:** "Your Life, In Sync." A central nervous system where documents, schedules, and communication live in perfect harmony.

## 2. Core Problem
*   **Fragmentation:** Modern work is scattered across disconnected "islands" (Notion, Slack, Asana, Google Calendar), leading to constant context switching and data silos.
*   **Misalignment:** When tools don't talk to each other, teams fall out of sync with strategy, a primary cause of startup failure.
*   **Manual Overload:** Professionals waste hours manually connecting dots—moving tasks to calendars, summarizing meetings, and managing permissions.

## 3. Target Audience
*   **Individuals & Professionals:** Knowledge workers seeking to align their personal and professional lives without the chaos of multiple apps.
*   **Startups & Enterprises:** Organizations needing a unified operating system to ensure strategic alignment and operational efficiency.
*   **Developers & Innovators:** Builders who want to extend an open, AI-native platform.
*   **Visionaries:** Founders and leaders looking for tools that adapt to their speed of thought.

## 4. The Solution: An AI-Native Ecosystem
Tuturuuu is a vertically integrated, all-in-one platform built on an open-source core.

### Core Applications
*   **Tudo (Flagship):** A centralized task manager with real-time collaboration (live cursors, Google Docs-style editing) and deep integration into calendar and documentation.
*   **TuPlan (Smart Calendar):** AI-driven auto-scheduling engine that slots tasks based on priority, streaks, energy levels, and buffer preferences. Supports "Locked Events" for immutable scheduling and two-way sync with Google Calendar.
*   **TuMeet:** comprehensive meeting management integrating scheduling, agendas, transcriptions, and follow-ups.
*   **TuChat & TuMail:** Integrated communication channels that keep conversations contextual and alongside the work.
*   **TuDrive:** A unified, intelligent storage system for all digital assets.
*   **Finance:** Integrated wallet tracking, budgeting, and financial planning.

### The Innovation Edge (R&D)
*   **Mira:** The central AI companion and "soul" of the platform.
*   **Aurora:** The invisible "nervous system" connecting all data points (non-LLM AI).
*   **Rewise:** A collective mind for knowledge management and retrieval.
*   **Nova:** A proprietary prompt engineering platform ("The Conscience").
*   **Crystal:** Multi-modal AI for real-time voice and video interaction ("The Bridge").
*   **Voice Agent:** A conversational interface to control the entire ecosystem via voice commands.

## 5. Core Value Propositions
*   **Startup Alignment (OS for Growth):** A comprehensive operating system designed to keep teams synchronized with strategy. We solve the fragmentation that causes startups to fail, providing everything needed to grow from idea to IPO.
*   **Unified Workspace:** Drastically reduces context switching by integrating tasks, calendar, finance, and documentation into a single, cohesive interface.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Security & Trust:** Built on a foundation of security with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for sensitive data, and infrastructure powered by SOC2+ certified cloud providers.
*   **Open Source Foundation:** A commitment to transparency, community-driven innovation, and no vendor lock-in.
*   **AI-Native & First-Class:** AI is not an addon; it is the foundation. Every product is "smart" and interconnected.
