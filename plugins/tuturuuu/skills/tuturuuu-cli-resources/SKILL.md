description: Configure and use ttr resources for concurrent local validation, worker limits, memory-pressure diagnosis, and reversible machine setup. Use when multiple agent sessions compete for CPU or RAM or before heavy local validation in an opted-in project.

# TTR Resource Control

Keep concurrent editing responsive by admitting heavy validation through one
per-user queue. Check `ttr resources help` and `ttr resources status --json`
before a broad test, build, type check, database setup, or browser suite.
These commands are local and require no login.

## Choose execution

- Prefer a verified remote runner for broad validation:
  `ttr box run --runner <remote-id> -- <command>`. Confirm its actual host and
  checkout; same-machine runners and containers do not offload CPU or RAM.
- For local work, use `ttr resources run -- <command>`. Sequence lint, tests,
  and browser QA. Do not start independent heavy commands with Promise.all,
  parallel shells, or background operators merely because separate threads
  own them.
- Run focused checks first. The queue does not excuse skipping required checks.
  Persistent development servers and custom subprocess fan-out still consume
  resources; start only services needed for the task and clean up your own.

## Setup and inspect

When machine setup is authorized, use:

```sh
ttr resources setup --root <repo> --shell zsh --dry-run
ttr resources setup --root <repo> --shell zsh
ttr resources status --json
```

Repeat `--root` for other repositories. Linked Git worktrees inherit repository
scope. Zsh/Bash hooks apply to new shells; `--shell none` avoids shell edits and
supports explicit queue use. Installation backs up shell files. Setup does not
modify repository source, Docker settings, credentials, or runner registrations.

The queue runs one job per user. Turbo runs one task; Vitest/Cargo workers adapt
to host RAM/CPU. Use `--workers` only for a justified override. Turbo task
concurrency alone does not cap Vitest's worker pool. Do not use separate
`TTR_RESOURCES_HOME` values across projects: that creates independent queues.

Elevated host memory pressure delays new admission. Keep the wait observable;
continue lightweight editing while it clears. Do not kill an owner, delete a
live lock, or routinely use `TTR_RESOURCES_BYPASS=1` / `--ignore-pressure` to
avoid waiting. A bypass is a deliberate exception for a known small operation.

## Diagnose and recover

`ttr resources monitor --seconds 60` emits bounded JSONL samples of memory
pressure, T3 descendants, and top processes, without command arguments or env
values. RSS differs from Activity Monitor's footprint. A snapshot does not prove
a historical leak. Identify the owning thread before interrupting active work.

If an older CLI lacks this command, report its version and use one serialized
validation command with explicit worker limits until the new CLI is installed;
do not silently launch unrestricted parallel validation.

`disable` / `enable` toggle future automatic admission. `uninstall` requires an
idle queue and removes only owned hooks/shims, preserving shell content and
backups. Existing processes, absolute binary paths, and replaced PATH values can
bypass automatic shims; explicitly wrap unrecognized commands. The queue is
cooperative scheduling, not an OS-enforced memory limit.
