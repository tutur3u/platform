# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Basics

GKE is a managed Kubernetes platform on Google Cloud for deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications. This skill defaults to the **golden path Autopilot configuration** — see [gke-golden-path.md](./references/gke-golden-path.md) for defaults, rules, and guardrails.

## Quick Start

```bash
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com --quiet
gcloud container clusters create-auto my-cluster --region=us-central1 --quiet
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --region=us-central1 --quiet
kubectl create deployment hello-server \
  --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
```
