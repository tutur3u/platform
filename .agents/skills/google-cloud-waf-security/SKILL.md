# Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework skill for the Security pillar

## Overview

The security pillar of the Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework provides
design principles and best practices for building a robust security posture by
integrating security into every layer of the architecture for cloud workloads.
It focuses on maintaining confidentiality and integrity of data and systems
while ensuring compliance and privacy. It provides a structured approach to risk
management, threat defense, and identity control, enabling you to operate cloud
workloads securely and at scale.

## Core principles

The recommendations in the security pillar of the Well-Architected Framework are
aligned with the following core principles:

-  **Implement security by design**: Integrate cloud security and network
   security considerations starting from the initial design phase of your
   applications and infrastructure. Google Cloud provides architecture
   blueprints and recommendations to help you apply this principle. Grounding
   document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/implement-security-by-design

-  **Implement zero trust**: Use a _never trust, always verify_ approach, where
   access to resources is granted based on continuous verification of trust.
   Google Cloud supports this principle through products like Chrome Enterprise
   Premium and Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP). Grounding document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/implement-zero-trust

-  **Implement shift-left security**: Implement security controls early in the
   software development lifecycle. Avoid security defects before system changes
   are made. Detect and fix security bugs early, fast, and reliably after the
   system changes are committed. Google Cloud supports this principle through
   products like Cloud Build, Binary Authorization, and Artifact Registry.
   Grounding document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/implement-shift-left-security

-  **Implement preemptive cyber defense**: Adopt a proactive approach to
   security by implementing robust fundamental measures like threat
   intelligence. This approach helps you build a foundation for more effective
   threat detection and response. Google Cloud's approach to layered security
   controls aligns with this principle. Google Cloud supports this principle
   through products like Security Command Center, Google Threat Intelligence,
   and Google SecOps. Grounding document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/implement-preemptive-cyber-defense

-  **Use AI securely and responsibly**: Develop and deploy AI systems in a
   responsible and secure manner. The recommendations for this principle are
   aligned with guidance in the AI and ML perspective of the Well-Architected
   Framework and in Google's Secure AI Framework (SAIF). Grounding document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/use-ai-securely-and-responsibly

-  **Use AI for security**: Use AI capabilities to improve your existing
   security systems and processes through Gemini in Security and overall
   platform-security capabilities. Use AI as a tool to increase the automation
   of remedial work and ensure security hygiene to make other systems more
   secure. Google Cloud supports this principle through products like Google
   Threat Intelligence and Google SecOps. Grounding document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/use-ai-for-security

-  **Meet regulatory, compliance, and privacy needs**: Adhere to
   industry-specific regulations, compliance standards, and privacy
   requirements. Google Cloud helps you meet these obligations through products
   like Assured Workloads, Organization Policy Service, and our compliance
   resource center. Grounding document:
   https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/meet-regulatory-compliance-and-privacy-needs
