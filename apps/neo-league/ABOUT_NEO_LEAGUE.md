# COMPETITION OVERVIEW

## ABOUT THE COMPETITION
Continuing with the season 1, the NEO League Season 2 - Innovation Humanity Challenge competition, hosted by RMIT Neo Culture Technology Club, offers university students across Vietnam a dynamic platform to develop and showcase their ability in hardware development that apply IoT Solution.

Each team of four participants (with diverse background across business, software engineer, robotics,...) will tackle progressively challenging tasks based on relevant themes, applying their skills to real-world problems.

The event includes three main rounds, starting with virtual preliminaries and culminating in a final on-site competition.

A panel of experts will evaluate submissions based on accuracy, relevance, creativity, and effectiveness. Winners will receive prizes such as internships and other valuable opportunities.

## VISION & MISSION

### OUR VISION
NEO League Season 2 - Innovation Humanity Challenge empowers STEM students to become innovators. We foster a hands-on community using IoT solution (or relevant tech that support) to build sustainable solutions for UN SDGs and real-world societal impact. By connecting students with industry professionals and partnering with RMIT, we aim to create a notable playground for STEM students, particularly in Hardware Development and IoT. 

### OUR MISSION
- Make Hardware Accessible: Open hardware development to all STEM students, regardless of background.
- Build Practical Skills: Teach hands-on programming, sensor integration, and prototyping to turn ideas into devices.
- Foster Community: Create a supportive space for students to collaborate, share knowledge, and inspire creation.
- Drive Sustainable Solutions: Apply tech skills to global issues and build prototypes for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
