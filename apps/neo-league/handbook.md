Handbook by RMIT NEO Culture Technology Club

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview: A student-led competition by RMIT'S NEO Culture Technology Club challenging Ho Chi Minh City undergraduates to engineer integrated IoT solutions.


Core Task: Combine physical prototyping with software, data connectivity, and smart technologies to address UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).


Timeline: March 2 – May 29, 2026.


Location: Virtual preliminaries; final on-site competition at RMIT Saigon South Campus.

2. ABOUT THE ORGANIZERS

Club: RMIT NEO Culture Technology Club.


Focus: Innovation in emerging technologies like machine learning and digital systems.


Community: 80+ members (undergraduates and alumni) and 30+ completed projects.


Core Values: Culture, Revolutionary, Companionship, Diversity, Inclusion.

3. COMPETITION OVERVIEW

Target Audience: Undergraduates over 18 years old from any university in Ho Chi Minh City.


Team Structure: Exactly 4 members per team with diverse backgrounds (e.g., Business, Software, Robotics).

Unique Selling Points:

Focuses on physical hardware prototyping rather than just ideation.

Rubric prioritizes technical feasibility and sensor integration.

Direct access to RMIT School of Science, Engineering & Technology (SSET) faculty for mentorship.

4. COMPETITION PHASES

Round 1 (Proposal): Submit a 10-slide digital IoT solution proposal targeting specific SDGs.


Round 2 (Prototype): Top 20 teams develop a functional physical prototype, technical documentation, and a 5-minute demo video.


Round 3 (Final Pitch): Top 5 finalists perform a live pitch and product demonstration at RMIT Campus.

5. IMPORTANT DATES (2026)

Opening Ceremony: March 28 (Virtual).


Top 20 Selection: April 24 (Virtual).


Top 5 Selection: May 16 (Virtual).


Finale - Exhibition: May 29 (RMIT Auditorium).

6. ELIGIBILITY & RULES

Hardware Mandatory: Projects must be functional physical prototypes; pure software is excluded.


Originality: Projects must be created specifically for Neo League Season 2.


Integrity: Zero tolerance for plagiarism or "ghost-building" (using external professional services).


Final Day Protocol: Finalists must surrender prototypes for morning inspection and have a 5-minute setup window before pitching.
