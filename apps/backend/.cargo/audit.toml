# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack - RSA timing sidechannel vulnerability
#
# This vulnerability affects the rsa 0.9.8 crate, which is only pulled into
# Cargo.lock through sqlx-mysql → sqlx-macros-core. We explicitly use
# PostgreSQL only (not MySQL) and have disabled default sqlx features.
#
# The rsa crate appears in Cargo.lock due to a known Cargo limitation with
# weak feature dependencies (rust-lang/cargo#10801), but it is NOT compiled
# into our binary or used at runtime. Running `cargo tree | grep rsa` confirms
# no actual dependency.
#
# Safe to ignore because:
# 1. MySQL driver is never instantiated or used
# 2. RSA code path is never executed
# 3. Vulnerability only affects MySQL authentication, not PostgreSQL
