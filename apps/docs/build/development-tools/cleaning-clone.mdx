<Info>
  This guide helps you reset your Tuturuuu repository to a clean state, which is
  useful if you encounter dependency issues or want to ensure a fresh
  development environment.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [bun](https://bun.sh/) installed (version 1.0.0 or higher recommended).
- Update bun to the latest version for best compatibility.

## Steps to Clean Your Clone

### 1. Delete the lockfile

Remove the `bun.lock` file at the root of your repository (if it exists):

```bash
rm bun.lock
```

### 2. Remove all `node_modules` folders

Use [npkill](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill) to find and remove all `node_modules` directories:

```bash
bunx npkill
```

- In the `npkill` interface, select and delete all `node_modules` folders found in your repo.

<Tip>
  If you don't have `npkill` installed, `bunx` will download and run it
  automatically.
</Tip>

### 3. Reinstall dependencies

Install all required dependencies using bun:

```bash
bun i
```

This will install fresh dependencies for all apps and packages in the monorepo.

<Info>
  After completing these steps, your repository should be in a clean state. You
  can now continue with the usual development workflow as described in{' '}
  <a href="/build/development-tools/development">Development</a>.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

- If you still encounter issues, try restarting your IDE or terminal.
- Make sure your bun version is up to date: `bun upgrade`.
- If problems persist, check the [Development](/build/development-tools/development) guide or ask for help in the project discussions.
