## Usage

To use [Meet Together](https://tuturuuu.com/calendar/meet-together), you need to create a new plan and invite your friends.

This will require you to select the `dates` and `times` that you are available to meet, and optionally change the plan `original timezone` as needed.

<Info>
  Once you have done this, a link will be **automatically generated** for you so
  that you can share with your friends and/or colleagues.
</Info>

They will be able to see the plan and select the dates and times that they are available to meet. Once everyone has selected their availability, you will be able to see the best time to meet with everyone.

## Saved Plans

You can also save your plans by logging in with a [Tuturuuu Account](https://tuturuuu.com/login). This will allow you to access the plan at a later time without having to manage links. Plans that you have filled out will also be automatically saved under your account.

## Plan Management

Everyone who has access to the plan will be able to see the plan details and the availability of everyone. Additionally, they will be able to change the plan name and delete the plan.

<Warning>
  Only send the link to people you trust, as they will have access to the plan
  details and the availability of everyone.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Plans are not automatically deleted, so make sure to delete them once you are
  done with them.
</Tip>
