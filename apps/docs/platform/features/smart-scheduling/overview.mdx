# Smart Scheduling

Smart Scheduling is an intelligent system that automatically schedules your habits and tasks on your calendar, respecting priorities, deadlines, and your preferences.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Unified Scheduling" icon="calendar-check">
    Habits and tasks are scheduled together in a coordinated manner, ensuring they don't conflict
  </Card>
  <Card title="Priority-Aware" icon="arrow-up-1-9">
    Items are scheduled based on priority, with urgent tasks able to bump lower-priority habits
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deadline Intelligence" icon="clock">
    Automatically infers priority from deadlines - items due soon get scheduled first
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Duration" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Habits can have min/max duration bounds, optimizing time based on slot availability
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

### 1. Priority Calculation

Every habit and task has an **effective priority** that determines scheduling order:

| Priority | Weight | Deadline Inference |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Critical | 4 | Overdue or due within 24 hours |
| High | 3 | Due within 24-48 hours |
| Normal | 2 | Due beyond 48 hours |
| Low | 1 | No deadline set |

<Note>
Explicit priorities always take precedence over inferred priorities. If you manually set a task as "Critical", it stays critical regardless of deadline.
</Note>

### 2. Scheduling Order

Smart Scheduling processes items in this order:

1. **Habits First** - Sorted by priority, then by ideal time preference
2. **Tasks Second** - Sorted by priority, then by deadline proximity
3. **Bumping** - Urgent (critical) tasks can bump lower-priority habit events
4. **Rescheduling** - Bumped habits are rescheduled to the next available slot

### 3. Duration Optimization

For habits with flexible duration (min/max bounds), the system optimizes duration based on slot characteristics:

```
Ideal Time Match → Maximum duration (get most value from preferred time)
Preference Match → Preferred duration (morning/afternoon/evening/night)
Constrained Slot → Minimum viable duration (still complete the habit)
No Match → Preferred duration (default behavior)
```

## Using Smart Schedule

### From the Calendar

Click the **Smart Schedule** button in the calendar toolbar to run scheduling for your workspace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Smart Schedule">
    Find the button in the calendar toolbar with the sparkle icon
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    The system analyzes your habits, tasks, and existing events
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Results">
    New calendar events appear automatically, with a toast notification showing the summary
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Automatic Scheduling

Smart Scheduling runs automatically every hour via a background cron job. This ensures your calendar stays up-to-date as you add new habits and tasks.

<Info>
The cron job only schedules items with `auto_schedule` enabled. You can enable/disable auto-scheduling per habit or task.
</Info>

## Configuration Options

### Window Days

Controls how far into the future to schedule events (default: 30 days, max: 90 days).

### Force Reschedule

When enabled, existing scheduled events are deleted and recreated. Use this to completely refresh your schedule.

<Warning>
Force reschedule will delete all auto-generated calendar events and create new ones. Manual events are not affected.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set Explicit Priorities for Important Items">
    While the system infers priority from deadlines, setting explicit priorities ensures your most important work is scheduled first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Flexible Duration for Habits">
    Set min/max duration bounds instead of fixed durations. This allows the system to optimize scheduling - using more time in ideal slots and less in constrained ones.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Ideal Times for Habits">
    Specify your preferred time (e.g., "07:00" for morning meditation). The system will prioritize these slots and allocate maximum duration when they're available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Deadlines Updated">
    The system uses deadlines to infer priority. Keep your task deadlines accurate for optimal scheduling.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  "windowDays": 30,
  "forceReschedule": false
}
```
