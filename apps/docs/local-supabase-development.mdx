<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: You should have installed
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and followed the
  [Development](/development) setup guide.
</Info>

## Overview

Tuturuuu utilizes Supabase for database management and authentication. This guide explains how to work efficiently with Supabase in the local development workflow.

## Basic Commands

### Starting Supabase

To start a local Supabase instance tailored for Tuturuuu:

```bash
pnpm sb:start
```

This command launches a local Supabase instance on your machine, accessible at [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003).

### Stopping Supabase

To stop the local Supabase instance:

```bash
pnpm sb:stop
```

### Checking Status

To view the current URLs and status of your local Supabase instance:

```bash
pnpm sb:status
```

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Startup

When developing for Tuturuuu, you have several options to start your environment:

1. **Standard Approach**: Start Next.js apps and Supabase separately.

   ```bash
   pnpm dev      # Starts all Next.js apps
   pnpm sb:start # Starts Supabase
   ```

2. **Enhanced Development Experience**: Use the `devx` command for a streamlined setup.

   ```bash
   pnpm devx
   ```

   This command:

   - Stops any running Supabase instance and saves current data as backup
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Starts a new Supabase instance (using backed up data)
   - Starts all Next.js apps in development mode

3. **Fresh Database Setup**: When switching branches with potential schema changes.
   ```bash
   pnpm sb:devrs
   ```
   This command:
   - Stops any running Supabase instance (without backup)
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Starts a new Supabase instance
   - Resets the database to use the latest schema
   - Starts all Next.js apps in development mode

<Warning>
  Use `pnpm sb:devrs` when switching between branches that might have different
  database migrations to ensure your local database schema matches the branch
  you're working on.
</Warning>

### Syncing With Schema Changes

If you're keeping your Next.js server running but need to reset your database to match the current branch's schema:

```bash
pnpm sb:reset
```

This command will reset your local database to use the latest schema definitions and automatically regenerate TypeScript types.

## Database Schema Management

### Making Schema Changes

There are two approaches to modifying the database schema:

#### 1. Using the Supabase UI

1. Navigate to your local Supabase Studio at [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003)
2. Make your changes through the UI
3. Generate a migration file:
   ```bash
   pnpm sb:diff
   ```
   This creates a migration file based on the differences between your current schema and the previous state.

<Warning>
  Be cautious when using `sb:diff` for schema changes. If you rename columns or
  tables, the migration will drop the old ones and create new ones, which can
  result in data loss in production environments.
</Warning>

#### 2. Creating Manual Migrations

For more control, you can create empty migration files and populate them manually:

```bash
pnpm sb:new
```

This creates a new empty migration file in `apps/db/supabase/migrations` that you can edit to include your desired schema changes.

### Applying Migrations

After creating a migration, apply it to your local database:

```bash
pnpm sb:up
```

<Info>
  This same process is used to keep our production database up-to-date with the
  schema defined in the `production` branch.
</Info>

### Generating TypeScript Types

After schema changes, regenerate the TypeScript types to keep your code in sync with the database schema:

```bash
pnpm sb:typegen
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand:

```bash
pnpm typegen
```

<Info>
  This step is automatically performed when running `pnpm sb:reset`, making it
  useful when catching up with a new branch's schema.
</Info>

## Migration Files

All migration files are stored in `apps/db/supabase/migrations`. These files:

- Contain SQL commands that create and modify the database schema
- Are executed in order based on the timestamp prefix in their filenames
- Include descriptive names after the timestamp to help developers understand their purpose

<Warning>
  When contributing new migrations in a Pull Request, always add them after the
  latest migration file from the `main` branch. This maintains the correct
  execution order and prevents issues when syncing the production database.
</Warning>

## Local Authentication

A local mail server (**InBucket**) is automatically set up by Supabase to handle authentication emails. You can access it at [http://localhost:8004](http://localhost:8004).

With InBucket, you can:

- Receive all authentication emails sent by your local Supabase instance
- Test any email combination without needing actual mail delivery
- View password reset links, confirmation emails, and other authentication flows
- Troubleshoot email templates and content

This makes it easy to test different authentication scenarios without configuring a real email service or waiting for actual email delivery.

Five seed accounts are pre-configured for local development:

1. local@tuturuuu.com
2. user1@tuturuuu.com
3. user2@tuturuuu.com
4. user3@tuturuuu.com
5. user4@tuturuuu.com

These accounts are already set up with the necessary data, allowing you to quickly test the app's functionality. However, you can register any new email address and the authentication emails will be captured by InBucket for you to inspect.

## Further Information

For more details about Supabase CLI usage, refer to the [Supabase CLI documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started).

## Row Level Security (RLS)

Row Level Security (RLS) is a powerful Postgres feature that allows you to control access to rows in a database table based on the user making the request. In Tuturuuu, we use RLS extensively to ensure data security.

### Enabling RLS

RLS should be enabled on all tables in exposed schemas (like `public`). When creating tables through the Supabase UI, RLS is enabled by default. For tables created using SQL, you need to explicitly enable RLS:

```sql
alter table <schema_name>.<table_name> enable row level security;
```

### Creating RLS Policies

Policies define the conditions under which users can access or modify data. Here are some common patterns used in Tuturuuu:

#### Organization-based Access

In Tuturuuu, most resources belong to an organization (workspace). Here's how to create policies for organization-based access:

```sql
-- Allow users to select data from their organizations
create policy "Users can view data from their organizations"
on public.table_name
for select
to authenticated
using (
  auth.uid() in (
    select user_id from public.workspace_members
    where workspace_id = table_name.workspace_id
  )
);

-- Allow organization admins to insert data
create policy "Organization admins can insert data"
on public.table_name
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  auth.uid() in (
    select user_id from public.workspace_members
    where workspace_id = table_name.workspace_id
    and role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Allow organization admins to update data
create policy "Organization admins can update data"
on public.table_name
for update
to authenticated
using (
  auth.uid() in (
    select user_id from public.workspace_members
    where workspace_id = table_name.workspace_id
    and role = 'admin'
  )
)
with check (
  auth.uid() in (
    select user_id from public.workspace_members
    where workspace_id = table_name.workspace_id
    and role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Allow organization admins to delete data
create policy "Organization admins can delete data"
on public.table_name
for delete
to authenticated
using (
  auth.uid() in (
    select user_id from public.workspace_members
    where workspace_id = table_name.workspace_id
    and role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

#### Role-based Access

For more granular control based on user roles:

```sql
-- Allow members with specific permission to access a resource
create policy "Members with view_projects permission can view projects"
on public.projects
for select
to authenticated
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from public.workspace_member_permissions
    where user_id = auth.uid()
    and workspace_id = projects.workspace_id
    and permission = 'view_projects'
  )
);
```

### Performance Optimization for RLS

For better performance in your RLS policies:

1. **Wrap function calls in subqueries**:

   ```sql
   -- Instead of this
   using (auth.uid() = user_id);

   -- Use this
   using ((select auth.uid()) = user_id);
   ```

2. **Use security definer functions** for complex access logic:

   ```sql
   create or replace function private.can_access_workspace(workspace_uuid uuid)
   returns boolean
   language plpgsql
   security definer
   as $$
   begin
     return exists (
       select 1 from public.workspace_members
       where user_id = auth.uid()
       and workspace_id = workspace_uuid
     );
   end;
   $$;

   -- Use the function in your policy
   create policy "Users can access workspace data"
   on public.table_name
   for select
   to authenticated
   using (private.can_access_workspace(workspace_id));
   ```

3. **Add explicit filters** in your queries even when you have RLS:
   ```typescript
   // Even though RLS will filter by workspace_id, adding the filter explicitly improves performance
   const { data } = await supabase
     .from('projects')
     .select()
     .eq('workspace_id', workspaceId);
   ```

### Testing RLS Policies

To test your RLS policies during local development:

1. Create a SQL file in `apps/db/supabase/tests` with your test cases
2. Use the `pnpm sb:test` command to run the tests

Example test file:

```sql
-- Test normal user can view their own workspace
BEGIN;
  SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;

  -- Mock the auth.uid() function
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.uid() RETURNS UUID LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ''user1-uuid''::UUID';

  -- Should return data
  SELECT is(
    (SELECT count(*) FROM public.projects WHERE workspace_id = 'workspace1-uuid'),
    1,
    'User should be able to see their workspace project'
  );

  -- Should return no data
  SELECT is(
    (SELECT count(*) FROM public.projects WHERE workspace_id = 'workspace2-uuid'),
    0,
    'User should not be able to see projects from other workspaces'
  );
ROLLBACK;
```

## Database Triggers

Triggers in Postgres allow you to automatically execute a function when a specified database event occurs (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). In Tuturuuu, we use triggers for various purposes like:

- Maintaining audit logs
- Syncing data between tables
- Enforcing complex business rules

### Creating Triggers

Here's how to create a trigger in your Tuturuuu development workflow:

1. First, create a trigger function:

```sql
create or replace function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
as $$
begin
  -- Create a personal workspace for the new user
  insert into public.workspaces (id, name, created_by)
  values (gen_random_uuid(), new.email || '''s workspace', new.id);

  -- Make the user an admin of their personal workspace
  insert into public.workspace_members (workspace_id, user_id, role)
  values (
    (select id from public.workspaces where created_by = new.id),
    new.id,
    'admin'
  );

  return new;
end;
$$;
```

2. Then, create the trigger:

```sql
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row
  execute function public.handle_new_user();
```

### Common Triggers in Tuturuuu

#### Audit Logging

```sql
create or replace function private.audit_log_changes()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
as $$
begin
  insert into public.audit_logs (
    table_name,
    record_id,
    action,
    old_data,
    new_data,
    performed_by
  )
  values (
    TG_TABLE_NAME,
    coalesce(new.id, old.id),
    TG_OP,
    case when TG_OP = 'DELETE' or TG_OP = 'UPDATE' then row_to_json(old) else null end,
    case when TG_OP = 'INSERT' or TG_OP = 'UPDATE' then row_to_json(new) else null end,
    coalesce(auth.uid(), '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid)
  );
  return coalesce(new, old);
end;
$$;

-- Apply this trigger to a table
create trigger projects_audit_trigger
  after insert or update or delete
  on public.projects
  for each row
  execute function private.audit_log_changes();
```

#### Automated Timestamps

```sql
create or replace function public.update_timestamp()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
as $$
begin
  new.updated_at = now();
  return new;
end;
$$;

-- Apply to a table
create trigger update_projects_timestamp
  before update
  on public.projects
  for each row
  execute function public.update_timestamp();
```

### Testing Triggers

You can test triggers by running SQL commands in the local Supabase instance and verifying the results:

```sql
-- Insert a test user
insert into auth.users (id, email)
values ('test-uuid', 'test@example.com');

-- Verify the trigger created a workspace
select * from public.workspaces where created_by = 'test-uuid';

-- Verify the user is an admin of the workspace
select * from public.workspace_members
where user_id = 'test-uuid' and role = 'admin';
```

## Seeding Your Database

Database seeding is the process of populating your database with initial data. In Tuturuuu, we use seeding to:

1. Create test users and workspaces for local development
2. Initialize lookup tables with standard values
3. Ensure a consistent starting point for all developers

### Seed Files Location

In Tuturuuu, seed files are stored in `apps/db/supabase/seed.sql`. This file is automatically executed when you run `pnpm sb:reset` or start a fresh Supabase instance.

### Real Examples from Tuturuuu's Seed File

Let's look at some real examples from Tuturuuu's seed.sql file:

#### 1. Authentication Users

The seed file creates five default test users with pre-set passwords:

```sql
-- Populate auth users
INSERT INTO
    "auth"."users" (
        "instance_id",
        "id",
        "aud",
        "role",
        "email",
        "encrypted_password",
        "email_confirmed_at",
        /* other fields... */
    )
VALUES
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
        'authenticated',
        'authenticated',
        'local@tuturuuu.com',
        crypt('password123', gen_salt('bf')),
        '2023-02-18 23:31:13.017218+00',
        /* other values... */
    ),
    /* additional users... */
```

All seed users have the same password: `password123`, making it easy to log in for testing.

#### 2. Workspaces

The seed creates several workspaces for testing different scenarios:

```sql
-- Populate workspaces
insert into
    public.workspaces (id, name, handle, creator_id)
values
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        'Tuturuuu',
        'tuturuuu',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
    ),
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
        'Prototype All',
        'prototype-all',
        null
    ),
    /* additional workspaces... */
```

#### 3. Workspace Members and Roles

The seed also sets up relationships between users and workspaces with different roles:

```sql
-- Populate workspace_members
insert into
    public.workspace_members (user_id, ws_id, role)
values
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        'OWNER'
    ),
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        'ADMIN'
    ),
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        'MEMBER'
    ),
    /* additional members... */
```

#### 4. Workspace Features Configuration

The seed file configures workspace features using secrets:

```sql
-- Populate workspace_secrets
insert into
    public.workspace_secrets (ws_id, name, value)
values
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        'ENABLE_CHAT',
        'true'
    ),
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
        'ENABLE_EDUCATION',
        'true'
    ),
    /* additional features... */
```

#### 5. Domain-specific Data

The seed includes domain-specific data for different workspace types. For example, healthcare data:

```sql
-- Populate healthcare_vitals
insert into
    public.healthcare_vitals (id, ws_id, name, unit)
values
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003',
        'Nhiệt độ',
        '°C'
    ),
    (
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002',
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003',
        'Chiều cao',
        'cm'
    ),
    /* additional vitals... */
```

### Creating Seed Data

Here's how to create and modify seed data:

1. Edit the `apps/db/supabase/seed.sql` file
2. Add SQL statements to insert your data
3. Run `pnpm sb:reset` to apply the seed data

Example seed data format:

```sql
-- Create a new user group
INSERT INTO public.workspace_user_groups (id, name, ws_id)
VALUES
  ('your-uuid-here', 'New Group', 'workspace-uuid-here')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Add a new workspace feature
INSERT INTO public.workspace_secrets (ws_id, name, value)
VALUES
  ('workspace-uuid-here', 'ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE', 'true')
ON CONFLICT (ws_id, name) DO UPDATE
SET value = EXCLUDED.value;
```

### Creating a Custom Seed File

Sometimes you might want to create a custom seed file for specific testing scenarios:

1. Create a new SQL file in the `apps/db/supabase` directory
2. Add your custom seed data
3. Run it with the Supabase CLI:

```bash
pnpm supabase db reset --db-url=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres -f apps/db/supabase/my_custom_seed.sql
```

### Exporting Current Data as Seed

You can also export your current database data to use as seed data:

```bash
# Export only data (not schema) to seed.sql
pnpm supabase db dump --db-url=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres --data-only > apps/db/supabase/new_seed.sql
```

This is helpful when you've set up data manually and want to preserve it for future development environments.

### Recommended Seeding Workflow

For Tuturuuu development, we recommend:

1. Start with a fresh database: `pnpm sb:reset`
2. Make changes through the UI or your app
3. When you're satisfied, export the data: `pnpm supabase db dump --data-only > apps/db/supabase/new_seed.sql`
4. Edit the generated SQL to keep only what you need
5. Update the main `seed.sql` file with your changes
6. Test by running `pnpm sb:reset` again
