This page distills the canonical rules defined in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/tutur3u/platform/blob/main/AGENTS.md). Treat the original document as the source of truth—this guide exists to make the most important expectations discoverable inside the docs site.

## Core Principles

- **Least privilege** – Touch only the files required for the task and keep changes scoped.
- **Deterministic & reproducible** – Generated artefacts must come from scripted commands; rerunning the workflow should produce the same result.
- **Security first** – Never surface secret values. Reference environment variables by name and keep sensitive flows audited.
- **Document intent** – When behaviour changes, update tests and docs alongside the code so the platform stays explainable.
- **Human-in-the-loop** – Escalate when work exceeds the documented boundaries (e.g., major refactors, new third-party services, complex data backfills).

## Capability Matrix

| Domain | You May | You Must | Never |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Code (TS/JS)** | Build Next.js App Router routes, React server/client components, shared packages | Add/adjust tests & types, update related docs | Ship breaking public API changes without a `BREAKING` note |
| **Code (Python)** | Modify apps under `apps/*` (python) with env isolation | Maintain pinned requirements / lockfiles | Blend unrelated refactors into feature work |
| **Database (Supabase)** | Author migrations in `apps/database/supabase/migrations`, run typegen | Commit regenerated `@tuturuuu/types` output | Hand-edit generated type files |
| **AI Endpoints** | Add handlers under `app/api/...` using Vercel AI SDK | Enforce auth + feature flags, validate payloads | Expose provider keys or skip validation |
| **Tooling** | Adjust configs (`biome.json`, `turbo.json`, etc.) | Document the rationale | Remove caching or security settings silently |
| **Docs** | Update `.md`/`.mdx` for accuracy | Cross-link neighbouring guides | Invent behaviour that is not implemented |
| **Dependencies** | `bun add --workspace` / remove deps | Prefer `workspace:*` for internal packages | Add duplicate versions already satisfied |

## Mandatory Guardrails

1. Do not run long-lived dev/build commands unless a human requests it (e.g., `bun dev`, `bun run build`).
2. **Supabase apply is user-only** – prepare migrations, but the user runs `bun sb:push` / `bun sb:linkpush`.
3. **Biome format/lint is user-only** – surface issues, but let the user execute `bun lint` / `bun format`.
4. Avoid committing noisy logs; add diagnostics only when they materially aid debugging.
5. Never commit credentials, tokens, or destructive migrations without a reversible plan.

## Escalate When…

- A migration needs >30 lines of backfill logic.
- A refactor would touch more than three apps or five packages.
- Introducing a new external service, adjusting auth flows, or changing env-var contracts.

## Canonical Workflows (Cheat Sheet)

- **Add/Update dependency** – scope → `bun add --workspace` → ensure types/docs → run targeted build.
- **New shared package** – scaffold under `packages/`, add `package.json` + `tsconfig`, export via `src/index.ts`, add tests & README, then build/test.
- **Next.js API route** – implement under `app/api/.../route.ts`, enforce auth, validate with Zod, add tests or docs.
- **AI structured endpoint** – define schema in `packages/ai`, use `generateObject`/`streamObject`, guard feature flags, redact secrets, handle errors gracefully.
- **Supabase migration** – run `bun sb:new`, author additive SQL, request user to apply and regenerate types via `bun sb:typegen`, commit regenerated files together.

See AGENTS.md §4 for full step-by-step instructions across all workflows.

## Collaboration Protocol

- Roles: Execution (ship code/docs), Review (verify lint/type/test/build), Architecture (cross-cutting improvements), Knowledge (docs & schema sync).
- Only one agent modifies a file set at a time; reviewers work read-only unless paired.
- Prefer linear history (rebases) and group commits by concern (schema vs code vs docs).

## Tooling & Environment Rules

- Single package manager: **Bun**. Use workspace filters (`bun --filter ...`) to target apps/packages.
- Supabase lifecycle via scripts: `sb:start`, `sb:stop`, `sb:new`, `sb:up`, `sb:typegen` (user applies pushes).
- Do not invent new caches; rely on Turborepo + Bun caching.
- Python services (`apps/discord/`) maintain their own pinned dependencies and README instructions.

## Testing & Quality Expectations

- Add happy-path and edge-case coverage where feasible; default to Vitest via `bun run test` or filtered scope.
- For DB changes, provide migrations, request the user apply them, then verify regenerated types.
- Performance-sensitive changes should document rationale in-code (≤3 lines) plus PR notes.
