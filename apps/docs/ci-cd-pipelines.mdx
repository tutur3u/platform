## Overview

Tuturuuu uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) across our monorepo. These automated workflows help us maintain code quality, run tests, and deploy our applications to various environments.

This page documents the key CI/CD pipelines used in the Tuturuuu platform and how they support our development workflow.

## Workflow Categories

Our GitHub Actions workflows are organized into several categories:

### 1. Application Deployments

Automated deployments to Vercel for our Next.js applications:

- Production deployments (from `production` branch)
- Preview deployments (from push events to non-production branches)

### 2. Database Migrations

Supabase database migration workflows for different environments:

- Production database migrations
- Staging database migrations
- Type generation verification

### 3. Package Publishing

Workflows that publish our shared packages to NPM, GitHub Packages, and JSR:

- Types package
- UI package
- Supabase client package
- ESLint config package
- TypeScript config package
- AI package

### 4. Quality Assurance

Workflows that ensure code quality:

- Unit tests
- Prettier formatting checks
- CodeQL security scanning
- CodeCov code coverage reporting

## Key Workflows

### Application Deployments

We use Vercel for deploying our Next.js applications. The main deployment workflows are:

#### Production Deployments

When code is pushed to the `production` branch, applications are automatically deployed to production:

```yaml
name: Vercel Platform Production Deployment
env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PLATFORM_PROJECT_ID }}
  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_URL }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY }}
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - production
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy-Production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Setup and optimization steps...
      - name: Check for newer commits
        id: check_commits
        run: |
          git fetch origin production
          LATEST_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse origin/production 2>/dev/null || echo "")
          CURRENT_COMMIT=${GITHUB_SHA}
          if [ -n "$LATEST_COMMIT" ] && [ "$LATEST_COMMIT" != "$CURRENT_COMMIT" ]; then
            echo "Newer commit found on production branch. Skipping build."
            echo "skip_build=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "This is the latest commit. Proceeding with build."
            echo "skip_build=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      # Deployment steps, only run if no newer commits found
      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
        run: vercel deploy --archive=tgz --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

We have separate production deployment workflows for each application:

- `vercel-production-platform.yaml` - Main web app
- `vercel-production-nova.yaml` - Nova application
- `vercel-production-rewise.yaml` - Rewise application
- `vercel-production-calendar.yaml` - Calendar application
- `vercel-production-mira.yaml` - Mira application

All production workflows follow the same pattern but deploy to different Vercel projects, each with its own environment variables and project ID.

#### Preview Deployments

For non-production branches, we create preview deployments that allow developers to see their changes live before merging:

```yaml
name: Vercel Platform Preview Deployment
env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PLATFORM_PROJECT_ID }}
  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - production
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy-Preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Setup and optimization steps...
      - name: Check for newer commits
        id: check_commits
        run: |
          CURRENT_BRANCH=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}
          git fetch origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
          # Skip if newer commits exist on the same branch
          # ... (commit checking logic)

      # Deployment steps, with conditional execution
      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=preview --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
        run: vercel build --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
        run: vercel deploy --archive=tgz --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

Preview deployments are set up for all our applications, providing a temporary deployment URL for each branch.

### Database Migrations

We use Supabase for our database, and have automated workflows for managing database migrations:

#### Production Database Migrations

```yaml
name: Supabase CI

on:
  # push:
  #   branches:
  #     - production
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Migrate production database
    timeout-minutes: 15
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD }}
      PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID }}
      PRODUCTION_DB_URL: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_DB_URL }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
        with:
          version: latest

      - name: Deploy migrations to production
        run: |
          cd apps/db
          supabase link --project-ref ${{ env.PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID }}
          supabase db push
```

This workflow is manually triggered (via `workflow_dispatch`) to deploy database migrations to production environment. This gives us control over when migrations are applied to production.

#### Supabase Type Verification

We ensure that generated TypeScript types match our database schema:

```yaml
name: Supabase CI

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Verify generated types
    timeout-minutes: 15
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DB_PASSWORD }}
      STAGING_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.STAGING_PROJECT_ID }}
      STAGING_DB_URL: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DB_URL }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
        with:
          version: latest

      - run: supabase init
      - run: supabase db start
      - name: Verify generated types match Postgres schema
        run: |
          supabase gen types typescript --local > schema.gen.ts
          if ! git diff --ignore-space-at-eol --exit-code --quiet schema.gen.ts; then
            echo "Detected uncommitted changes after build. See status below:"
            git diff
            exit 1
          fi
```

This workflow runs on every push, ensuring that our TypeScript types are always in sync with the database schema.

### Package Publishing

We publish several packages to make our code reusable across projects. Here's an example workflow for the types package:

```yaml
name: Release @tuturuuu/types package

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    paths:
      - 'packages/types/package.json'
      - 'packages/types/jsr.json'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-version-bump:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && contains(github.event.pull_request.title, 'chore(@tuturuuu/types)')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      should_release: ${{ steps.check.outputs.should_release }}
    steps:
      - id: check
        run: echo "should_release=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  build:
    needs: check-version-bump
    if: needs.check-version-bump.outputs.should_release == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Build steps

  publish-jsr:
    needs: [build]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      # Setup steps
      - name: Publish package to JSR
        working-directory: packages/types
        run: pnpm dlx jsr publish

  publish-npm:
    needs: [build]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      packages: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      # Setup steps
      - name: Publish package
        working-directory: packages/types
        run: pnpm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```

Our package publishing workflows follow a pattern:

1. Check for a version bump in the package.json and ensure the PR title follows our convention
2. Build and test the package
3. Publish to multiple registries (JSR, GitHub Packages, NPM)

We have similar workflows for other packages:

- `release-ui-package.yaml`
- `release-ai-package.yaml`
- `release-supabase-package.yaml`
- `release-eslint-config-package.yaml`
- `release-typescript-config-package.yaml`

### Quality Assurance

We use several workflows to ensure code quality:

#### Unit Tests

```yaml
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    name: Unit Tests
    timeout-minutes: 15
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [22]

    env:
      # Use Vercel Remote Caching
      TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
      TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}

      # Configure environment variables
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }}
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
      SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY }}

    steps:
      # Setup steps
      - name: Test
        run: pnpm test
```

This workflow runs on every push to main and on all pull requests, ensuring our tests pass.

#### Prettier Formatting

We enforce consistent code formatting with Prettier using an automated workflow that can create PRs for formatting fixes:

```yaml
name: Prettier Format Check

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  format:
    name: Prettier Check
    timeout-minutes: 10
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [23]

    steps:
      # Setup steps
      - name: Check Prettier formatting
        id: check-format
        run: pnpm format:check || echo "format_failed=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Apply Prettier fixes
        if: steps.check-format.outputs.format_failed == 'true'
        run: pnpm format

      - name: Check for changes
        if: steps.check-format.outputs.format_failed == 'true'
        id: git-check
        run: |
          if [[ -n $(git status --porcelain) ]]; then
            echo "changes=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "changes=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      - name: Create Pull Request
        if: steps.git-check.outputs.changes == 'true'
        id: create-pr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          commit-message: 'style: apply prettier formatting'
          title: 'style: apply prettier formatting for ${{ github.ref_name }}'
          body: |
            This PR fixes code formatting issues using Prettier.
            Auto-generated by the Prettier Format Check workflow.
          branch: fix/prettier-formatting-${{ github.ref_name }}
          base: ${{ github.ref_name }}
          delete-branch: true
```

This workflow not only checks code formatting but also:

1. Automatically applies Prettier fixes if formatting issues are found
2. Creates a pull request with the fixes
3. Adds informative comments to existing PRs if formatting issues are detected

## Workflow Organization

Our GitHub Actions workflows are all defined in the `.github/workflows` directory of the repository. They follow a consistent naming convention:

### Application Deployment Workflows

- `vercel-production-*.yaml`: Production deployment workflows for each application
  - Example: `vercel-production-platform.yaml`, `vercel-production-nova.yaml`
- `vercel-preview-*.yaml`: Preview deployment workflows for each application
  - Example: `vercel-preview-platform.yaml`, `vercel-preview-nova.yaml`

### Database Workflows

- `supabase-production.yaml`: Production database migrations
- `supabase-staging.yaml`: Staging database migrations
- `supabase-types.yaml`: TypeScript type verification

### Package Publishing Workflows

- `release-*-package.yaml`: Package publishing workflows
  - Example: `release-ui-package.yaml`, `release-types-package.yaml`

### Quality Assurance Workflows

- `turbo-unit-tests.yaml`: Unit test workflow
- `prettier-check.yaml`: Code formatting workflow
- `codecov.yaml`: Code coverage reporting
- `codeql.yml`: Security scanning

### Other Utilities

- `check-and-bump-versions.yaml`: Automated dependency version management
- `external-internal-packages.yaml`: Managing external vs internal dependencies

## Common Workflow Patterns

Our workflows follow several common patterns:

### 1. Conditional Execution

Many workflows check if they should run based on certain conditions:

```yaml
- name: Check for newer commits
  id: check_commits
  run: |
    # Logic to determine if build should be skipped
    echo "skip_build=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- name: Next step
  if: steps.check_commits.outputs.skip_build != 'true'
  run: echo "Only runs if no newer commits were found"
```

### 2. Dependency Caching

Most workflows use caching to speed up builds:

```yaml
- name: Cache turbo build setup
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .turbo
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-turbo-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-turbo-

- name: Setup pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4

- name: Use Node.js 22
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22
    cache: 'pnpm'
```

### 3. PR-based Publishing

Package releases are triggered by merged PRs with specific title patterns:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    paths:
      - 'packages/types/package.json'
  # ...

jobs:
  check-version-bump:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && contains(github.event.pull_request.title, 'chore(@tuturuuu/types)')
    # ...
```

## Environment Variables and Secrets

Our workflows use several environment variables and secrets stored in GitHub:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: For deploying to Vercel
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_*_PROJECT_ID`: Project-specific Vercel IDs
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: For authenticating with Supabase
- `*_SUPABASE_URL`, `*_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `*_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Environment-specific Supabase credentials
- `NPM_TOKEN`: For publishing to NPM
- `TIPTAP_PRO_TOKEN`: For accessing Tiptap Pro packages
- `TURBO_TOKEN` and `TURBO_TEAM`: For Turborepo remote caching

<Warning>
  Never hard-code sensitive information in workflow files. Always use GitHub
  Secrets for API tokens, passwords, and other sensitive data.
</Warning>

## Remote Caching with Turborepo

We leverage Turborepo's remote caching feature in our CI pipelines to speed up builds:

```yaml
env:
  # Use Vercel Remote Caching
  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}
```

This allows our CI jobs to reuse cached build artifacts from previous runs, significantly reducing build times. For large monorepos like ours, this can reduce CI times from 20+ minutes to just a few minutes when the cache is warm.

## Best Practices

When working with our CI/CD pipelines, follow these best practices:

### 1. Test Workflows Locally

Before creating a new workflow, test it locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) or similar tools.

```bash
# Install act
brew install act

# Run a specific workflow locally
act -W .github/workflows/your-workflow.yaml
```

### 2. Keep Workflows Focused

Each workflow should have a single responsibility. Split complex workflows into smaller, more focused ones.

### 3. Reuse Common Steps

Use composite actions or job templates to reuse common steps across workflows.

### 4. Monitor Workflow Performance

Regularly check workflow runs for performance issues and optimize as needed:

1. Use GitHub's workflow visualization to identify bottlenecks
2. Implement caching for dependencies and build artifacts
3. Run jobs in parallel when possible
4. Skip unnecessary steps with conditional execution

### 5. Document Workflow Changes

When making significant changes to workflows, document them in pull request descriptions and update this documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Workflow Timeouts

If a workflow times out, it might be due to:

- Inefficient build process
- Missing cache configuration
- Network issues with external services

Try adding or improving caching strategies and optimizing build steps.

#### 2. Failed Deployments

When deployments fail, check:

- Build logs for errors
- Environment variable configuration
- Access tokens and permissions

#### 3. Authentication Issues

For authentication problems with NPM, GitHub Packages, or Vercel:

- Verify token permissions
- Ensure tokens are not expired
- Check that the token is correctly configured in GitHub Secrets

## Creating New Workflows

When creating a new workflow, use this checklist:

1. **Naming Convention**: Follow the established naming patterns
2. **Trigger Conditions**: Define when the workflow should run
3. **Environment Variables**: Include all necessary secrets and variables
4. **Optimizations**: Add caching and conditional execution
5. **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling and notifications
6. **Documentation**: Add comments within the workflow file and update documentation
